Installing Monoreports
======================

Monoreports can be installed on Linux and Windows 
(and probably MacOs - i don't have Mac machine )


Dependencies
------------

To build MonoReports you need to have mono 2.6 or higher

Binary version
------------------
I've found that on Windows and  Ubuntu 10.10 binary version works out of box
so if you want to play with designer simply grab binary package monoreports.zip


Building from source
----------------------

1. install git

2. clone repository

git clone git://github.com/tomaszkubacki/monoreports.git

3. enter cloned directory and run:

	./configure
	make
