Run report from code
--------------------
If you don't like/need designer, there is a project demonstrating how to create and run report from code in ****doc/example/MrptInvoiceExample****.

Basic Concepts
==============

What is Monoreports ?
---------------------
Monoreports is a reporting tool used to design and generate reports from object datasources. Datasource can anything from database data or file to dynamically generated data.

Monoreports consists of two main parts:

***report designer***  gtk-sharp application to design reports
***report engine***  engine is responsible for generating report from report designed in designer and data pushed to datasource

Report
------
Report is a template for result report. Every report has serveral sections. In sections you place controls.
Control can be bound to a datasource, parameter or expression.

Sections
--------

Section is empty space on the report. Sections differ by location and [...]

1. ***Report Header*** the first section printed at report top. It's printed once per report.
2. ***Page Header*** this section is printed at top of every page except first page (where report header is first)
3. ***Details*** this section is printed as many times as many rows there is in the data source
4. ***Page Footer*** printed at bottom of the page
5. ***Report Footer*** printed at the end of report

Controls
--------
There are three basic types of controls:

1. Textblock - represents text on report, can be bound to datafield, has background, border and font related properties
2. Line  - can be vertical horizontal (to make things easier in a designer)
3. Image - at the moment only static images are supported

and one more complex:

***Subreport control*** (currently not supported)
