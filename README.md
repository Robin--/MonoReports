Monoreports

Monoreport is a report designer and reporting engine for .net/mono  
It's similar to the CrystalReport (TM) and other tools like that.

Monoreports features:

- sections - every report consists of few sections e.g. report header detail, page heder/footer each section can be formated independly

- page breaking - Monoreports engine will break or keep together report sections whatever is needed

Near Future

At the moment Monoreports lack of two feauters commonly used in this kind of tools. Those are functinalities i'm currently working on:

- Group section - detail section records are broken by group header and group footer sections when grouping field change

- Subreports - including report in report

Final Remarks

Monoreports is still not ready to day 0 so be patient please :)
