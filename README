Monoreports is a reporting engine written in C# (mono). It's similar to JasperReports and other tools like that.

Monoreports consists of two main modules (monodevelop projects):
	Monoreports - report designer
	Monoreports.Model - reporting engine

Designer is build on the top of gtk-sharp and cairo graphics library.

At the moment it's not in an usable state !!
